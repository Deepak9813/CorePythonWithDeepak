#==================== Unpacked Tuple =================
# Assigning the elements of a tuple into the different variable in a single line is known as tuple unpacking.


# a,b,c,d = (1,2,3,4)


# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(d)



# print(type(a))


#swap two numbers:

# b = 5

# print(f"Before swapping,Value of a = {a}")
# print(f"Before swapping value of b = {b}")


# c = a           #c = 2
# a = b           #a = 5
