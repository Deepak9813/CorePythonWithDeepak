============ Rules for Identifiers(Variable, Functions, Class,etc.) =========
Identifier is name that is given to variable, functions, class,etc.

1. Combination of uppercase,lowercase,digits and underscore.
eg: 
name = "Deepak"
myVariable = 20
myVariable1 =30

2. Cannot start with digits.
eg:
1myVarible = 20 (wrong)
myVariable1 = 20   (Correct)

3. only use under in middle.
my_variable = 30 (correct)
my$Variable = 30(wrong)

4. Can be any length.
my_variable_ho_hai_bro = 40
timro_nam_k_ho = "Ramesh"

5. always write meaningfull names of identifiers.
example:
x = "Deepak"  (Correct but not meaningful)
name = "Deepak" (Correct and meaningful)

"""



#example of variable
# name = "Deepak"
# age = 28
# PI = 3.142  #constant kura lai ==> give capital variable name

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(PI)

============ Multiculture case ==============
eg: my var name 

1.pascal case:  [ClassName,FileName]

2. camel case:  [variable,function,objectname,etc.]
myVarName = "Deepak Baij"

studentInfoHo()
studentInfo()


[Best : python standard]
3. snake case: [variable,function,objectname,etc.]
