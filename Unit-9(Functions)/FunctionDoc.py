        Function:
        Function is a block of code that perform specific task when we call it.



        # Advantage of function:
        1. Reduce code redundancy(i.e. remove duplicate code)
        2. Increase code readability.
        3. Increase code resuability.
        3. Enhance(provide) security.


        Types of functions:
        1. predefined function (inbuilt function)

        The function that are already defined and provided (given) by the python
        is known as predefined function
        Example:-
        len(), print(), input(), type(), id(), int(), float(),  etc

        2. User defined function

        The functions that are defined by the user is known as User defined function.
        We use "def" keyword infront of function name to define user defined function.

        Syntax:

        #function definition
        def functionName():
            #function body (i.e. block of code)

        #function calling
        functionName()

        3. lambda function
        4. Recursive function
